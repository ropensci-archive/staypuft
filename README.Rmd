`staypuft` is a port of Python's [marshmallow][] for converting objects to and from R data structures 

Main `Schema` methods:
- `load`: 'deserialize', or validate and deserialize an input R data structure (e.g., list) to an object
- `dump`: 'serialize', or convert any input (e.g., R6 class) to R data structures (e.g., list)
- `load_json`: same as `load`, but accepts JSON
- `dump_json`: same as `dump`, but returns JSON

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/staypuft")
```

```{r}
library("staypuft")
```

## example

```{r}
z <- Schema$new("MySchema",
  name = fields$character(),
  title = fields$character(),
  num = fields$integer()
)
z
x <- list(name = "Jane Doe", title = "Howdy doody", num = 5.5)
z$load(data = x)
```
